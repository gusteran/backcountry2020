                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>Where in the park do you want to go? The park can be roughly divided into an east and west side 
                    by the Continental Divide. Trails on the east side of the park typically start at an elevation 
                    of about 5000 ft, and contain many open spaces, making them more popular than the western trails. 
                    Western trails typically start around 3200 ft and feature more forests and fewer people. </p>

                <h3>Step 6</h3>
                <p>Plan alternate routes. Only about one half to two thirds of visitors who apply for 
                    backpacking permits get their first choice for trips. You can submit up to 3 additional 
                    routes on your application, so plan some possible alternative routes.
                </p>
